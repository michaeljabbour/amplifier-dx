AMPLIFIER CONCEPTUAL DOCUMENTATION INDEX
=========================================

This document indexes the new conceptual/pedagogical documentation located in the docs/ directory.
These docs provide a "mental spa" experience for understanding Amplifier architecture.


DOCUMENT INDEX
--------------

00-index.md       - Master index and reading paths
01-data-flow.md   - Visual diagrams of how data flows through Amplifier
02-certainties.md - Contracts and guarantees developers can rely on
03-mental-models.md - Analogies: Orchestra, Kitchen, Airport, Lego, Assembly Line
04-what-happens-when.md - Concrete scenarios traced step by step
05-quick-start.md - 5-minute understanding for busy people
06-layers.md      - Progressive depth: Use → Configure → Extend → Embed → Understand
07-desktop-case-study.md - Real-world embedding example (Amplifier Desktop)


READING PATHS BY GOAL
---------------------

"I just want to use it":
  05-quick-start.md → main docs quickstart

"I need to configure it for my team":
  05-quick-start.md → 01-data-flow.md → main docs profiles

"I want to write a custom tool":
  06-layers.md (Layer 3) → main docs creating modules

"I'm building a product on Amplifier":
  01-data-flow.md → 02-certainties.md → 07-desktop-case-study.md → API docs

"I want to understand everything":
  All documents in order → source code


KEY CONCEPTS COVERED
--------------------

1. DATA FLOW
   - The 5 components: Provider, Tool, Context, Orchestrator, Hook
   - Step-by-step prompt processing
   - Event stream tracing
   - File system storage locations

2. CERTAINTIES (Contracts)
   - Hooks always fire
   - Events are ordered
   - Context is append-only
   - Tools are isolated
   - Provider responses are immutable
   - Configuration hierarchy is deterministic
   - Hooks can block, tools cannot

3. MENTAL MODELS
   - Orchestra: Conductor (orchestrator), instruments (tools), soloist (LLM)
   - Kitchen: Head chef (orchestrator), stations (tools), ticket rail (context)
   - Airport: Security (hooks), air traffic control (orchestrator), flight log (context)
   - Lego Set: Bricks (modules), instructions (profiles), built creation (session)
   - Assembly Line: Conveyor (context), stations (tools), quality control (hooks)

4. SCENARIOS COVERED
   - Simple question (no tools)
   - File operation (single tool)
   - Multi-tool task
   - Hook blocking
   - Streaming response
   - Profile inheritance
   - Error recovery
   - Session persistence

5. UNDERSTANDING LAYERS
   - Layer 1: USE - Run commands, get work done
   - Layer 2: CONFIGURE - Profiles, settings, module selection
   - Layer 3: EXTEND - Write custom tools and hooks
   - Layer 4: EMBED - Use as a library in your app
   - Layer 5: UNDERSTAND - Internals, architecture, contribute


DESIGN PHILOSOPHY
-----------------

These docs follow pedagogical principles:

1. PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE
   Start simple, add depth gradually. Most people never need past Layer 2.

2. MULTIPLE ENTRY POINTS
   Quick start for the impatient, deep dives for the curious.

3. VISUAL FIRST
   ASCII diagrams make concepts stick.

4. CONCRETE EXAMPLES
   Every concept has a worked example.

5. HONEST LIMITATIONS
   "What We Don't Guarantee" builds trust.

6. ANALOGIES FOR INTUITION
   Mental models turn complexity into intuition.


INTEGRATION NOTES
-----------------

These docs complement the main site (index.html) by providing:
- Deeper conceptual understanding
- Visual architecture diagrams
- Progressive learning paths
- Real-world case studies

The main site focuses on: How to do things
These docs focus on: How to think about things
